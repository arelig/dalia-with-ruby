# DALIA

This app was created with the purpose of migrating an existing one in android and learning ruby ​​on rails.

Services

* Dalia wants to provide you a better understanding about your plants. Do you forget when was the last time you watered your plants? Me too!
* It is a simple CRUD design with system notification for each watering reminder.

You may be wondering where I got the criteria to know how long you have to wait to water your plant the next time, well, the reality is that it is not a definitive process, you have to take into account the various variables of the environment. I asked my grandmothers and botanists for advice to define the different categories of plants arranged here in the application with the intention of creating a generality. It is important that the plant caretaker visit the basic information on soil moisture and normal conditions of the same.
