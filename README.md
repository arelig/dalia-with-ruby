# DALIA

This app was created with the purpose of migrating an existing one in android and learning ruby ​​on rails.

Services

* Dalia wants to provide you a better understanding about your plants. Do you forget when was the last time you watered your plants? Me too!
* It's a simple CRUD design, each plant is an entity, it has his last watered date and the next one. 

You might wonder where did I take the criteria to know what amount of time you have to wait to water your plant the next time, well, the reallity is that it's not a definitive process, you have to take in account the several  environment variables. I asked my grandmothers and botanists for advice to define the different categories of plants arranged here in the application.
